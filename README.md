Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris
This repository contains the completed project files of the Coursera course "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris" by Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The course teaches you how to build a modern computer system from the ground up, starting with the basic building block of all modern computers: the NAND gate.
Course Overview
The course is divided into two parts:
Part I: Hardware: In this part, you will build a computer system from the ground up, starting with the basic building block of all modern computers: the NAND gate. You will learn how to design and build a CPU, a memory system, and an input/output system.
Part II: Software: In this part, you will write low-level programs in the machine language of the computer you built in Part I. You will then build a high-level programming language and a compiler for it, and write programs in the high-level language.
Repository Contents
This repository contains the completed project files for both parts of the course. The projects are organized into directories for each week of the course. Each directory contains a README file that explains the project and how to run it.


Then, navigate to the directory for the project you want to run and follow the instructions in the README file.
Acknowledgments
The projects in this repository were completed as part of the Coursera course "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris" by Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The course was created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.
